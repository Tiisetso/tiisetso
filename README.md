### Hi, I'm Tiisetso

I'm an industrial engineer from South Africa. I'm currently learning C at Hive, a peer to peer coding school, in Helsinki.

I am passionate about technology and the role it plays in improving lives. I'm a tinkerer at heart with ambitions of being worthy of the inventor and founder labels. 

My interests are wide and varied as I'm curious by nature and enjoy deep diving common and esoteric topics alike. Always looking to collaborate and contribute to projects. 

At present when not at school, you'll find me refining my home assistant setup or running many Zone 1 miles.
