### Hi, I'm Tiisetso

I'm an industrial engineer from South Africa. I'm currently learning C at Hive, a peer to peer coding school, in Helsinki.

Explore my school projects [here](https://github.com/Tiisetso/Hive).

When not writing code, I can be found writing thoughts on my [personal blog](https://tiiset.so/) and running many miles around the city.
